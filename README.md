# web-scraping-challenge

This challenge consists of two deliverables:

- Deliverable 1 consists of scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

- Deliverable 2 consists of scraping and analyzing Mars weather data.

The repo contains a jupyter notebook for each of the challenges: part_1_mars_news.ipynb for deliverable 1 and part_2_mars_weather.ipynb for deliverable 2. The repo also contains a .csv file containing the mars weather data needed for the challenge.
