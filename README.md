# web-scraping-challenge

This challenge consists of two deliverables:

- Deliverable 1 consists of scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

- Deliverable 2 consists of scraping and analyzing Mars weather data.

The repo contains a jupyter notebook for each of the challenges: part_1_mars_news.ipynb for deliverable 1 and part_2_mars_weather.ipynb for deliverable 2. The repo also contains a .csv file containing the mars weather data needed for the challenge.

The following questions were addressed:
- How many months exist on Mars? Data showed that there are 12 months on Mars.
- How many Martian days' worth of data are there? Results showed that there are 1867 days on Mars.
- Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? Results showed that month 3 has the coldest or lowest temperature, while month 8 has the warmest or highest temperature.
- Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? Data showed that month 6 has the lowest atmospheric pressure, while month 9 has the highest atmospheric pressure.
- How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made. A total of 1867 days comprise a martian year. Data also show that temperature also fluctuates depending on the number of terrestrial days on Mars.
